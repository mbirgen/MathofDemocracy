        <em>Present Value of an Annuity:</em>
        <me>
          P = R\frac{1-(1+\frac rn)^{-nt}}{\frac rn}
        </me>
        or
        <me>
          P = R\frac{1-(1+i)^{-m}}{i}

        The Present Value formula states how much a series of payments is worth
        <em>as one lump sum at the beginning</em>.
        This can show up in several different ways; here are four.

            <em>How much money do you need now to fund a series of future payments?</em>
            Example: You are planning to retire at age 68.
            You will need a $50,000 payment each year to live on,
            and you plan to be retired for 20 years.
            The interest rate is 6%. How much money do you need in your retirement account when you retire?

            <em>What is a fair price to charge now in exchange for paying someone regularly in the future?</em>
            Example: You run a retirement home,
            and an elderly man named George wants to pay you a fixed sum now to have you take care of him for the rest of his life.
            It will cost you $2000 per month to take care of George,
            and he will probably live another 15 years.
            You can get interest rates of 5% compounded monthly.
            How much should you charge George?

            <em>What is a fair price to pay for something that will pay you regularly in the future?</em>
            Example: You are an investor looking at buying a copper mine.
            The mine will produce an annual profit of $1,200,000 per year for its owner for the next 20 years,
            but then the ore will run out.
            Interest rates are sitting at 4%. How much would be a fair price to pay for the mine?

            <em>How does a loan amount relate to the regular loan payment?</em>
            Example: You put a $2000 down payment on a $12,000 car,
            financing the rest with a 5-year loan at 6% interest, compounded monthly.

                  You have <m>65-22 = 43</m> working years,

        Some time ago Steve Smith took out a mortgage from First National State Local Bank;
        his payment was $900 per month.
        FNSLB is strapped for cash these days, so it's considering
        <q>selling the mortgage</q>
        to Seventh National Bank;
        in other words, SNB will pay FNSLB a certain sum of money,
        and in return SNB will get all Steve Smith's remaining mortgage payments.
        There are 187 payments remaining on the mortgage,
        and interest rates are at 4% per year.
        How much should FNSLB charge Seventh National Bank to buy the mortgage?

              for a total of $1{,}000{,}000 paid out.
              Assuming that annual interest rates will stay at 5%, what is the present value of this prize?
              In other words,

                  You get an annuity of $50,000 per year for 20 years.
                  The annuity is worth <m>\displaystyle \dollar50{,}000 \dfrac{1-(1+\frac{.05}{1})^{-20\cdot 1}}{\frac{.05}{1}} = \dollar623{,}110.52</m>.

              Assuming 5% interest rates,

                  You get $50,000 today, plus an annuity of $50,000 per year for 19 years.
                  The annuity is worth <m>\displaystyle \dollar50{,}000 \dfrac{1-(1+\frac{.05}{1})^{-19\cdot 1}}{\frac{.05}{1}} = \dollar604{,}266.04</m>,
                  so adding in the $50,000 you get paid now,
