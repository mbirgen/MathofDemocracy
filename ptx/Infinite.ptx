  <title>Familiar, but Infinite</title>
  <p>
    What is familiar and concrete to one person may be foreign and abstract to another,
    but as far as numbers are concerned we probably all agree on which are the most familiar.
    In 1886 Leopold Kronecker, a number theorist,
    made a statement about what is basic in the world of mathematics:
    <q>God created the positive integers;
    all the rest is human creation.</q>
  </p>
  <p>
    One, two, three, .. . these are the positive integers.
    For every positive integer there is a next bigger one.
    Although we may think of these positive integers successively,
    we may also think of all of them at once, that is,
    think about the collection of all positive integers.
    The collection
    (also referred to as the set)
    of positive integers is so basic and natural to our way of thinking that it is called the set of natural numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The set of all natural numbers is our first infinite set,
    and it has a comfortable feel about it.
    Among infinite sets, the natural numbers seem the most natural.
    By examining this and related collections of numbers,
    we will begin to develop a better and more precise idea of infinity.

    <em>Question:</em> Are there as many natural numbers as there are integers starting with 2, 3, 4, .. . , we are asking neither more nor less than the question: Is there a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the set
    <me>
      2, 3, 4, ..
    </me>.
    and the set of natural numbers
    <me>
      1, 2, 3, .. . ?
    </me>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Naturally even</em>.
          Let <m>E</m> stand for the set of all even natural numbers (so <m>E = (2, 4, 6, 8, .... )</m>).
          Show that the set <m>E</m> and the set of all natural numbers have the same cardinality by describing an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the two sets.

          <em>5's take over</em>.
          Let <em>EIF</em> be the set of all natural numbers ending in 5
          (<em>EIF</em> stands for "ends in five").
          That is,
          <me>
            \mathbf{EIF} = (5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, . . . )
          </me>.
          Describe a one-to-one correspondence between the set of natural numbers and the set <em>EIF</em>.

          <em>6 times as much</em>.
          If we let <m>\mathbb{N}</m> stand for the set of all natural numbers,
          then we write <m>6\mathbb{N}</m> for the set of natural numbers all multiplied by 6 (so <m>6\mathbb{N} = (6, 12, 18, 24, . .. )</m>).
          Show that the sets <m>\mathbb{N}</m> and
          <m>6\mathbb{N}</m> have the same cardinality by describing an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the two sets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Any times as much</em>.
          If we let <m>\mathbb{N}</m> stand for the set of all natural numbers,
          and <m>a</m> stand for any particular natural number,
          then we write <m>a\mathbb{N}</m> for the set of natural numbers all multiplied by <m>a</m>.
          Do the sets <m>\mathbb{N}</m> and
          <m>a\mathbb{N}</m> have the same cardinality?
          If so, describe an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the two sets.

          <em>Reciprocals</em>.
          Suppose <m>R</m> is the set defined by
          <me>
            R = 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, ...
          </me>.
          Describe the set <m>R</m> in words.
          Show that it has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers.

          <em>Half way</em>.
          Suppose you take the line below, \hrulefill cut it in half,
          and then take the left piece and cut it in half,
          and then take the leftmost piece and cut it in half,
          and so on, without ever stopping.
          How many different pieces of the line would you have?
          Does the set of all pieces have the same cardinality as the set of all natural numbers?
          Justify your answer.
