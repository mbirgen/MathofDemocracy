    The general formula for Future Value <m>F</m> is
    <me>
      <mrow>F=\amp R(1 +\frac rn)^{nt-1}+R(1 +\frac rn)^{nt-2}+\cdots +R(1 +\frac rn)^1+R</mrow>
      <mrow>=\amp  R\frac{(1+\frac rn)^{nt}-1}{\frac rn}</mrow>

        An <term>annuity</term> is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals.
        For an <term>ordinary annuity</term>,
        the payments are made at the <em>end</em> of the interval.
          <idx><h>annuity</h><h>ordinary</h></idx>
      If the payments are made at the
        <em>beginning</em> of the interval,
        it is called an <term>annuity due</term>.
        We will not be working with this type of annuity in this class.

      A good way to think about these is as a savings account.
        You are putting some money, <m>R</m>,
        into the account every compounding period in order to save up for something in the future.

        <em>Future Value of an Annuity:</em>
        <me>
          F=R\left(\frac{(1+\frac rn)^{nt}-1}{\frac rn}\right)
        </me>
        If we let <m>i=\frac{r}{n}</m> and <m>m=nt</m>,
        we can shorten the formula to:
        <me>
          F=R\left(\frac{(1+i)^{m}-1}{i}\right)

            Joe Parsimmons said he would set up an ordinary annuity for his newborn niece Gloria and deposit $100 each month,
            with the last payment to occur on her 18th birthday.
            The payments would earn 6% annual interest, compounded monthly.
