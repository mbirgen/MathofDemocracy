  <title>Subtraction versus Negatives</title>
  <p>
    On Texas Instruments calculators,
    there are two keys with horizontal lines.
    The main <kbd>-</kbd> key is for
    <em>subtraction</em>, like <m>5-4</m>.
    When you type in a <em>negative number</em> like <m>-6</m>,
    however, you must use the smaller <kbd>(-)</kbd> key,
    usually located in the bottom row of your calculator.
    If you use the wrong button,
    you will probably see a screen like this: \calcscreen{ERR:SYNTAX
  </p>
  <p>
    \makebox[0pt][l]{\rule{12pt}{11pt}}1:Quit
  </p>
  <p>
    2:Goto}
