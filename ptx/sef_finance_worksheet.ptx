        You take out a subsidized student loan at 4.66% compounded monthly.
        You have a monthly discretionary income  of $ P/month of which you can put up to 20% towards paying off your loan.
        To calculate P, take your current age divided by 3 times 100.
        What is the largest loan you can get under each plan?
        <em>Standard Repayment</em> With the standard plan,
        you'll pay a fixed amount each month until your loans are paid in full.
        Your monthly payments will be at least $50,
        and you'll have up to 10 years to repay your loans.
        The standard plan is good for you if you can handle higher monthly payments because you'll repay your loans more quickly.
        Your monthly payment under the standard plan may be higher than it would be under the other plans because your loans will be repaid in the shortest time.
        For the same reason <mdash/> the 10-year limit on repayment <mdash/> you may pay the least interest.
        <em>Extended Repayment</em> To be eligible for the extended plan,
        you must have more than $30,000 in Direct Loan debt and you must not have an outstanding balance on a Direct Loan as of October 7, 1998.
        Under the extended plan you have 25 years for repayment.

        You want to take 5 years to save up a 20% down payment for your house.
        What is the value of the house if you take out the loan you found in <xref ref="EPpart2">part</xref> with a 20% down payment?
        How much would you have to put aside monthly to save up that amount?
        What percentage of your monthly income of $P is that?

      <p>
        If you are also spending 28% of your monthly income on rent,
        how much money do you have to live on during the time you are paying off your loan and saving up for your house?
