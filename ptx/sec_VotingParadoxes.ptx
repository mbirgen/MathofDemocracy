              <answer>

                  Irving defeats Joseph and Karl in head-to-head matches,
                  but Joseph wins via plurality.

              The five voters in the last column really do think \D<nbsp/>is the best candidate and \B<nbsp/>is the second-best.
              However, they decide to be sneaky and lie on their Borda count ballots,
              claiming they think \B<nbsp/>is the worst candidate;
              in other words,
              they say they prefer \D, H, Z, and \B<nbsp/>in that order.

              Explain in a few complete sentences how these voters manipulated the Borda count and why it is unfair.
              <answer>
                <p>
                  These voters filled out their ballots deceptively,
                  downgrading the candidate they opposed in order to make their own candidate do well by comparison.
                  This is unfair because it gives dishonest voters more power than honest ones. (Graders,
                  be generous with students' explanations!) \else

            How many of the 3,000 voters are happy with the result?
            <answer>
              <p>
                Since this will cost taxpayers $1,100,000, \fbox{none of the voters} will be happy.

            Explain in a few complete sentences what is odd or paradoxical about this situation.
            <answer>
              <p>
                Each of the voters deliberately voted to limit spending,
                yet they collectively ended up spending more than any of them wanted. \ifgradersolns (Graders,
