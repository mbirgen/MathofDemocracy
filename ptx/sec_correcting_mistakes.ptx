    At some point in this course you will probably type in a long,
    complex expression wrong, and you'll have to fix it.
    Instead of retyping the whole thing,
    you might be able to just edit your earlier attempt!
    One of the following may work on your calculator:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          pressing the up arrow key <m>\blacktriangle</m> to scroll up to the earlier line
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          pressing 2ND ENTER to access the latest
          <q><c>ENTRY</c></q>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you do this, you might need to insert new symbols,
    such as parentheses, into your earlier wrong entry.
    Be sure to change into insert mode (
    <q><c> INS</c></q>
    ) by pressing 2ND DEL ; this will let you insert new characters.
    Unfortunately, the calculator will switch back to normal
    <q>overtype</q>
    mode as soon as you press an arrow key to move to another location,
    so you'll need to press 2ND DEL again.
