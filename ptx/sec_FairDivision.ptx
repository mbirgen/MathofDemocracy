      \begin{enumerate}

    <p>
      \item My friend and I decide have pizza for dinner.
      We order pizza which is half red sauce with pepperoni and half garlic sauce with ham and pineapple.
      To my friend, pizza is pizza.
      He has no preference for one type of pizza over another.
      On the other hand, I have an allergy to oregano and cannot eat any red sauce.
      It gives me a horrible stomach ache and I'm grumpy for about eight hours.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            What is a fair way to divide this pizza so that my friend and I both believe we are getting a value of at least 50% of the pizza.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            My friend never remembers that I do not eat red sauce.
            Therefore, he divides the pizza so that each half has exactly half red sauce and half garlic sauce.
            Am I able to choose a slice where I receive 50% of the value of the pizza?
            <answer>
              <p>
                Yes
              </p>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose instead, I slice the pizza.
            When I do so,
            because I value the red sauce part as nothing, I divide the pizza so that one slice is all garlic sauce and the other slice is all red sauce.
            Have I divided the pizza in such a way that each slice is worth 50% to me?
            <answer>
              <p>
                No, because one slice is worth 100% and the other 0% to me.
              </p>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is there a way that I could divide the pizza in order to have each slice worth 50% to me and have all the red sauce on one of the slices?
            <answer>
              <p>
                Yes.
                One slice would have all red plus 1/2 of the garlic.
              </p>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the case above, which of the slices with my friend choose?
            <answer>
              <p>
                The larger one.

      The basic issue at all fair division problems can be stated in a reasonably simple terms: How can something that must be shared by a set of competing parties be divided among them in a way that ensures that each party receives a fair share?
      Of course, part of the answer to this question will involve defining what we mean by a fair share.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are going to start with the most common method for fair division,
      that of the divider-chooser.
          <idx><h>divider-chooser</h></idx>
      This is the problem where there are two people and one thing to divide.
      One person has chosen to do the cutting,
      and then the other person gets to choose which part they want.

            <answer>
              <p>
                Each of the players is a thinking,
                rational agent seeking to maximize his or her share of the booty <m>S</m>.
                We further assume that in pursuit of this goal,
                a player's moves are based on reason alone.

                The players are willing participants and accept the rules of the game as binding.
                The rules are such that after a <em>finite</em>
                number of moves by the players the game terminates with a division of <m>S</m>.

                Players have no useful information on the other players' value systems,
                and thus if what kinds of moves they are going to make in the game.

                Players have <em>equal</em> rights in sharing the set <m>S</m>.
                A consequence of this assumption is that at a minimum,
                each player is entitled to a <em>proportional</em> share of <m>S</m>,
                that is <m>\frac{S}{N}</m> when there are <m>N</m> players.

      \item Sometimes it is easier to work with fair division problems when we put a monetary value on the object being divided because then we can quantify how much each piece is worth to each player.
      Suppose the cost of the pizza which is half red sauce and half white sauce is $10.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            My friend never remembers that I do not eat red sauce.
            Therefore, he divide the pizza so that each half has exactly half red sauce and half garlic sauce.
            How much is each slice of pizza worth to my friend?
            How much is each slice of pizza worth to me?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose instead, I slice the pizza.
            When I do so,
            because I value the red sauce part as nothing, I divide the pizza so that one slice is all garlic sauce and the other slice is all red sauce.
            How much is each slice of pizza worth to me?
            How much of each slice of pizza worth to my friend?
            If I do the division, why is this not a fair division of the pizza?
            What happens if my friend is the one doing the division?
            Is it fair?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now, divide the pizza in such a way that all the red sauce is in one slice yet both slices are worth five dollars to me.
            How much is each slice of the pizza worth to my friend?
            If I do the division, why is this a fair division of the pizza?
            What happens if my friend is the one doing the division?
            Is it fair?

    <answer>
      <p>
        One of the players is assigned to be the divider.
        The player divides the booty into equal shares
        (according to him).
        The other players are called the choosers.
        They indicate which of the shares are fair according to them.
        The booty is split by giving each of the choosers one of the shares they have indicated and the divider gets the remaining share.\else

                  David - <m>s_2</m>, Carol - <m>s_3</m>, Charlotte - <m>s_1</m> Because David has a fair share of <m>s_1</m>,
                  the only other option for Charlotte is <m>s_3</m>.

          Four partners (Evan, Fiona, Greg,
          and Harry) are dividing a piece of land valued at $480,000 among themselves using the lone-divider method.
          Using a map,
          the divider divides the property into four parcels,
          <m>s_1,s_2,s_3</m> and <m>s_4</m>.
          The following table shows the value of each of the four parcels in the eyes of each partner,
          but some of the information in the table is missing.

      There is one complication that can happen with the lone-divider method we have not yet discussed.
      It happens when two players want one and only one of the shares.
      This can be solved, but requires a little more analysis.

      Sometimes you want to split up items without physically cutting them apart.
      For example,
      suppose Sally is living with two roommates and everyone is graduating.
      Over the years,
      they have purchased some appliances together and now they need to fairly divide the appliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the method of sealed bids,
      each roommate is going to write down what they believe is a fair value for each appliance and seal the
      <q>bids</q>
      in an envelope.
      When the envelopes are opened,
      we get the following results:

          Three women (Carrie, Jeri,
          and Violet) share an apartment and wish to divide the chores:
          bathrooms, cooking, dishes, laundry, and vacuuming.
          For each chore,
          they privately write the least they are willing to receive monthly
          (their negative valuation)
          in return for doing that chore.
          The results are shown in the following table.
