  <title>Rounding Errors</title>
  <p>
    We all know that <m>\frac{1}{3} \times 300 = 100</m>,
    but sometimes when working with a calculator we can get wrong answers: \calcscreen{1/3
  </p>
  <p>
    \ca .3333333333
  </p>
  <p>
    \ca 99.99999999} The calculator is not at fault here;
    it has not made any mistakes.
    The decimal equivalent of <m>\rec{3}</m> is <m>0.33333333333333333333\ldots</m>;
    it goes on forever.
    The calculator gives us as many digits as it can,
    but <c>.3333333333</c> is just a
    <em>rounded-off approximation</em> of <m>\rec{3}</m>.
    When we then typed <c>.3333333333</c> back into the calculator and multiplied by 300,
    the calculator accurately told us the answer was 99.99999999, not 100.
    This is called an <em>rounding error</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example,
    the difference between what the calculator told us and the real answer is only <m>0.00000001</m>,
    which is not terribly bad.
    Often students round off long decimals to only a few decimal places,
    which is okay for a final answer,
    but then they run into more problems: \calcscreen{1/3
  </p>
  <p>
    \ca .3333333333
  </p>
  <p>
    \ca 99} Now we got an answer of 99 instead of 100, which seems more significant.
    In the more complicated expressions of the financial math chapter,
    we can end up with errors of several dollars
    (possibly hundreds of dollars)
    if we're not careful.
    For example,
    if we need to calculate <m>\dollar600 \cdot \frac{1-(1+\frac{.07}{12})^{-12\cdot 25}}{\frac{.07}{12}}</m>,
    a common student error would be this: \calcscreen{(1-(1+.07/12)\caret(\tineg12*25))/
  </p>
  <p>
    \ca 141.486903386
  </p>
  <p>
    \ca 84894} Whereas this student answered $84,894.00, the correct answer
    (to the nearest penny)
    is $84,892.14;
    that's $1.86 too high, enough to lose points on a test.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus when the calculator gives you numbers you will use again later in the problem,
    <em>never round them off</em>.
    Always type back in <em>all</em> the digits.
    Only round off at the very end of the problem!
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this can <em>still</em> cause small errors
    (as we saw in the first example),
    and it's annoying to punch <c>141.486903386</c> into the calculator.
    There are at least three better solutions to the rounding error problem,
    all of which involve <em>keeping the numbers in the calculator until the end</em>.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          One solution is to combine your whole formula into one step in the calculator.
          <tabular>
            <row>
              <cell><em>Example 1:</em></cell>
              <cell><em>Example 2:</em>
                <sidebyside>
                  (1/3)*300 \ca 100
                </sidebyside></cell>
              <cell><sidebyside>
                  600*(1-(1+.07/12)\caret(\tineg12* 25))/(.07/12) \ca 84892.1420313
                </sidebyside></cell>
            </row>
          </tabular>
          The downside of this approach is that writing the formula all in one line can be long,
          error-prone, and just plain unpleasant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An alternative is to break up your calculation into steps using <c>Ans</c>.
          Most calculators have a feature to remember the most recent answer they computed;
          on a TI machine,
          this is represented by the symbol <c>Ans</c>.
          The <c>Ans</c> automatically appears if you start a line by pressing an operation like <kbd>+</kbd> or <kbd><m>\div</m></kbd> , or you can also get it by pressing the <kbd>2ND</kbd> key and then the <kbd>(-)</kbd> key.
          <tabular>
            <row>
              <cell><em>Example 1:</em></cell>
              <cell><em>Example 2:</em>
                <sidebyside>
                  1/3 \ca 0.3333333333 Ans*300 \ca 100
                </sidebyside></cell>
              <cell><sidebyside>
                  (1-(1+.07/12)\caret(\tineg12*25))/ (.07/12) \ca 141.486903386 600*Ans \ca 84892.1420313
                </sidebyside></cell>
            </row>
          </tabular>
          In Example 1, the keystrokes used were <kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>/</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd> <kbd>ENTER</kbd> and then <kbd>*</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>ENTER</kbd> ; the <c>Ans</c> was automatically generated by the calculator.
          In Example 2, the keys punched in the second line were <kbd>6</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>*</kbd> <kbd>2ND</kbd> <kbd>(-)</kbd> <kbd>ENTER</kbd> .
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The calculator's <c>Ans</c> ability remembers just one number,
          the result of the most recent calculation.
          There is also a more powerful way to use the calculator's memory,
          using <em>variables</em>, which are letters that stand for numbers.
          Most keys on your TI calculator have a letter printed above them and to the right;
          on a TI-84 Plus Silver Edition calculator,
          for example, one key looks like this:
          <tabular>
            <row>
              <cell>TEST A</cell>
            </row>
            <row>
              <cell>MATH</cell>
            </row>
          </tabular>
          To get the letter, you first press the <kbd>ALPHA</kbd> key,
          and then the key with the desired letter;
          for example, <kbd>ALPHA</kbd> <kbd>MATH</kbd> produces an
          <q><c>A</c></q>
          on the screen.
          You can make the calculator remember any number at all by <em>storing</em>
          it to a variable, whose name is a letter.
          You use the \stokey<nbsp/>key, which writes a little
          <q><m>\rightarrow</m></q>
          symbol on the screen.
          Then you choose which letter you want to represent your number,
          and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
          The first line of this example was created on my TI-84 Plus Silver Edition by pressing <kbd>5</kbd> \stokey <kbd>ALPHA</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>ENTER</kbd> . \calcscreen{4+1<m>\rightarrow</m>A \ca 5 5-2<m>\rightarrow</m>B \ca 3 A*B \ca 15} The use of variables can be immensely helpful,
          especially if you are doing lots of calculations with the same numbers;
          they also sometimes mean you need fewer parentheses.
          Take a look at our two examples one last time.
