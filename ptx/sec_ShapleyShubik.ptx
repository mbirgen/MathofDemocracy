        In the weighted voting system
        <m>[4 | 3, 2, 1]</m>, Is there a voter who is always pivotal?
        Is there a voter who is never pivotal?
        <answer>
          <p>
            To calculate the power of a voter,
            count the number of times the voter is pivotal.
            Then divide by the total number of sequential coalitions.
            Calculate the power of each voter in the weighted voting system <m>[4 | 3, 2, 1]</m>.
            Just like in the previous power index,
            the sum of all the powers must equal one.

        In some cities the city Council operates under what is known as the,
        <q>strong <mdash/> mayor</q>. Under this system the city Council can pass a motion under a simple majority,
        but the mayor has the power to veto the decision.
        The mayor's veto can then be overruled by a
        <q>super majority</q>
          <idx><h>super majority</h></idx>
        of the council members.
        As an example, consider the city of Ice-n-knock.
        In Ice-n-knock,
        the city Council has four members plus a strong mayor who has a vote as well as the power to veto motion supported by a simple majority of the council members.
        On the other hand,
        the mayor cannot veto a motion supported by all four Council members.
        Thus, a motion can pass if the mayor +2 or more Council members supported or,
        alternatively,
        if the mayor is against it at the four council members support it.
        It makes sense that under these rules,
        the four council members have the same amount of power,
        but the mayor has more.
        Compute the Shapley-Shubik Power Index of this weighted voting system to figure out exactly how much more.
        <answer>
          <p>
            Focus on the last sentence.
            A motion can pass if the mayor +2 or more Council members supported or,
            alternatively,
            if the mayor is against it at the four council members support it.
            The Mayor is pivotal whenever they are in the third or fourth position in a sequential coalition.
            There are 4! of each of these sequential coalitions.
            So <mdash/> there are a total of 5!=120 total sequential coalitions.
            The Mayor is pivotal in <m>2\times 4! = 48</m> of them.
            Each council member is pivotal in <m>\frac{120-48}{4}=18</m> of them.
            The Mayor has power of 40% and each Council member has a power of 15%.
          </p>
        </answer>
        For purposes of comparison,
        calculate the Banzhaf power distribution of Ice-n-knock.
        <answer>
          <p>
            This will probably not happen.
            But, there are winning coalitions of 3, 4, and 5 players.
            The 5 member coalition has no critical members.
            There are 5 4-member coalitions. 4 of them have the Mayor as a member and they are the only critical member of those coalitions.
            The fifth, without the Mayor, each member is critical.
            There are 6 3-member winning coalitions that contain the Mayor.
            All members are critical in each of these coalitions.
            So, the Mayor is critical in <m>4+6=10</m> places.
            The total number of critical council members is <m>4 + 6*2=16</m> places.
            Thus, our denominator is 26,
            the Mayor's numerator is 10 and each Council member's numerator is 4.
            The Mayor has power of 38.5% and each Council member has a power of 15.4%.

                There are several ways to answer this question.
                For example,
                voter <m>P_2</m> has twenty times more weight than voter <m>P_3</m>,
                but they have exactly the same power.
                Another way to see it is that voter <m>P_1</m> has fully three times as much power as voter <m>P_2</m>,
                even though the weights of 24 and 20 are not that different.
