        \setcounter{tempyear}{\arabic{currentyear}-18} Clarence Phelps bought a house in \arabic{tempyear} for $158,000.
        At that time he put 15% down and got a 25-year mortgage at 4.75% interest.
        Since \arabic{tempyear} his home's value has increased by 60%. What is Clarence's equity in his house today (in the year \arabic{currentyear})?
        <answer>
          <p>
            We first find that his mortgage payment is $765.67.
            Thus he still owes $54,625.41 on the loan.
            His home's value is now $252,800, so his equity is $198,174.59.
