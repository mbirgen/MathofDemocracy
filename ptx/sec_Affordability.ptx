              <answer>
                <p>
                  An origination fee usually varies from 0.5%
                  (half a point)
                  to 2%
                  (two points)
                  of a given loan amount,
                  depending on whether the loan was originated in the prime or the subprime market.
                  For example,
                  an origination fee of 2% on a $200,000 loan is $4,000.[2]\else

        Erik and Kristin Halvorson want to buy a house for $148,000.
        They want a standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage.
        They can get an interest rate of 3.5% from their bank,
        but they will have to pay two points to the bank.
        They have saved up enough for a 10% down payment.
        Home insurance will cost $1500 per year,
        and property taxes are $1800 annually.

      <ol>

            Calculate the Halvorsons' closing costs.
            <answer>
              <p>
                The closing costs consist of down payments and points and fees.
                The down payment is 10% of $148,000, namely $14,800.
                Thus the loan amount is <m>\dollar148{,}000-\dollar14{,}800 = \dollar133{,}200</m>.
                Two points are 2% of the loan amount, namely $2664.
                Thus their closing costs are

              <p>
                Principal and Interest can be found from the present value formula.
                We are looking for the <m>P</m> such that <m>\dollar133{,}200 = P \dfrac{1-(1+\frac{.035}{12})^{-12\cdot 30}}{\frac{.035}{12}}</m>.
                Solving, we get <m>P=\dollar598.13</m> per month for Principal and Interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for Taxes,
                they are $1800 per year so <m>\dollar1800\div 12 = \dollar150</m> per month.
                Likewise the Insurance costs <m>\dollar1500 \div 12 = \dollar125</m> per month.

        You have saved up $10,500 towards a down payment,
        and you calculate that you can afford $1100 per month for housing total (PITI).
        Real estate taxes for a house in your city will probably be about $2300 per year,
        and insurance will be about $1600 annually.
        You can get a 30-year mortgage with 4% interest, compounded monthly.
