            any set of players that might join forces and vote the same way.
            In principle,
            we can have a coalition with as few as <em>one</em>
            player and as many as <em>all</em> players.
            The coalition consisting of all the players is called the
            <em>grand coalition</em>.
            Since coalitions are just sets of players,
            the most convenient way to describe coalitions mathematically is to use the
            <em>set</em> notation. \else

            one that has enough votes to win.
            A single player coalition can be a winning coalition only when that player is a dictator,
            so under the assumption that there are no dictators in our weighted voting system
            (dictators are boring)
            a winning coalition must have at least two players. \else

            explain in complete sentences why the weight controlled by the voter is not the same thing as the power held by each voter.
            <answer>
              <p>
                There are several ways to answer this question.
                For example,
                voter <m>P_2</m> has twenty times more weight than voter <m>P_3</m>,
                but they have exactly the same power.
                Another way to see it is that voter <m>P_1</m> has fully three times as much power as voter <m>P_2</m>,
                even though the weights of 24 and 20 are not that different.
