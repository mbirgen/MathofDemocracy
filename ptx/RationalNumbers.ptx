  <title>Rational Numbers</title>
  <p>
    We might feel more or less stymied in our quest for an infinite set bigger than the set of natural numbers.
    But let's not forget that lots of numbers are not integers.
    For example, how about the rational numbers?
    Recall that the set of rational numbers is the set of all ratios of integers
    (fractions).
    Between any two integers there are infinitely many rationals.
    Within the set of rational numbers,
    we actually have infinitely many different infinite sets.
    The set of rational numbers must be huge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, in our search for different sizes of infinity,
    the rationals are still not numerous enough.
    We rely once again on the definition of same cardinality;
    namely, two sets have the same cardinality if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of one set and the elements of the other.
    The trick here is to write down the rational numbers in a convenient and systematic way so that we know we have listed them all.
    The idea is to put all the rational numbers with numerator 1 in one column,
    all those with numerator 2 in another column,
    and so on as shown in the following diagram.
    Notice that all the rationals in the same row have the same denominator.
    For example, to find 37/112 in the diagram,
    we just go 37 spaces to the right of 0 and 112 spaces up.
    So, we can see that all the rational numbers appear somewhere in the pattern.
    In fact, each rational number appears many times,
    because the fractions are not all reduced to lowest terms.
    For example, 1/2 appears and so does 2/4, 3/6, and so on,
    but that redundancy is okay,
    because at this point we merely want a systematic method of writing down every rational number without leaving any out.
    Notice that all the positive rational numbers appear in the upper-right part of the diagram,
    all the negative rationals appear in the lower left,
    and 0 is right in the middle.
    So far, then,
    we have described a way of writing down all the rational numbers.

    } To show the one-to-one correspondence between the rational numbers and the natural numbers,
    we will thread a single rectangular spiral through all the rationals,
    starting in the middle at 0 and moving counterclockwise outward.
    To see the one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers,
    we will just count the rational numbers as we encounter them along the spiral and make them bold-face to remind us that we have paired that rational with some natural number.
    We start with the rational O corresponding to the natural number l ; then,
    moving to the nght and up,
    the rational <m>1/1 = 1</m> corresponds to the natural number 2, the rational
    <m>-1/1 = - 1</m> corresponds to 3, the rational <m>2/1 = 2</m> corresponds to 4.
    We next come to 2/2, which has already been counted,
    so we skip it and move to 1/2, which corresponds to 5, then -2/1 = -2 corresponds to 6.
    We skip -2/2 since that equals - 1, which already corresponds to 3, and move to -1/2, which corresponds to 7, and so on.
    Notice that eve1y rational number will eventually be reached and put in correspondence with some natural number.
    This one-to-one correspondence shows that the set of all rational numbers has the same cardinality as the set of the natural numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Threading the spiral and counting along it provides an important insight into sets with the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers.
    If we can write a set out as an infinite list,
    we can make a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    We now see that the rational numbers did not provide us with an infinity larger than that of the natural numbers.
    Our quest for an even grander infinity has thus far failed.
    But perhaps when we are chasing sets larger than an infinite set,
    we should expect to have to go a long, long way.

          <em>A grand union</em>.
          Suppose you have two sets,
          each having the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers.
          Take the elements of both sets and put them together to make one huge set.
          Prove that this new huge set has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers.

          <em> Unnoticeable pruning</em>.
          Suppose you have any infinite set.
          Is it always possible to remove some things from that set such that the collection of remaining things has the same cardinality as the original set?
          Explain why or why not, and illustrate your answer with an example.
