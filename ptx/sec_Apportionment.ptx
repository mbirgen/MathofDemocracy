      Another mathematical challenge in most Democratic systems is that of Apportionment.
      Essentially the problem is one of representation.
      Seats in the House of Representatives are given to the states based on population.
      There are 435 seats for 2323.1 million people.
      That works out to <m>323100000/435 = 742758.6207</m> or about <m>742,759</m> people per seat in the House.
      However, even though North Dakota, Vermont,
      and Wyoming all have smaller populations than that they are guaranteed a seat in the House.
      Also, if you look at the other states,
      it is very rare that their population is exactly an even multiple of <m>742,759</m>.
      This section is all about how to fairly appoint seats in a house of representatives,
      as well as a variety of other tasks that turn out to be essentially the same thing.

          The Republic of Awoi is a small country consisting of four states North-West (population 69,000), South-West (population 267,000), South-East (population 133,000) and North-East
          (population 331,000).
          Suppose that there are 160 seats in the Awoi Congress to be apportioned among the four states based on their representative populations.

              On average, how many people per congress seat should there be?

    <answer>
      <p>
        The upper quota is the standard quota rounded up and the lower quota is the standard quota rounded down.
        A fair apportionment will lead to all states having either their upper or lower quota.

    <answer>
      <p>
        Assign all states their lower quota.
        Then, to assign the extra seats,
        look at the state with the largest decimal part in its standard quota and assign it the upper quota.
        Continue until all extra seats are assigned.

          What was the Standard Divisor that was used to apportion Amabala's seats?
          <answer>
          </answer>
          \hrulefill Now, imagine that the number of seats is suddenly
          <em>increased to 201</em>,
          but <em>nothing else changes</em>.
          Since there is one more seat to give out,
          the apportionment has to be recomputed.

              It has to change because the number of seats has changed.

          Ten years later a new census was taken which showed only a few changes in state populations <mdash/> an 8 million increase in the population of Gamma and a 1 million increase in the population of Epsilon.
          <em>The populations of the other states remained unchanged.</em>

                It has to change because your total population has changed.

          The W-CF Garbage Company has a contract to provide garbage collection and recycling services to the two towns of Waterloo (with 89,550 homes) and Cedar Falls
          (with 10,450 homes).
          The company runs 100 little garbage trucks,
          which are apportioned under Hamilton's method according to the number of homes in the district.
          A quick calculation shows that the standard divisor is <m>SD=1000</m> homes,
          a nice, round number which makes the rest of the calculations easy.

          Now, the W-CF Garbage Company is bidding to expand its territory by adding the town of Evansdale (5250 homes) to its service area.
          In the bid, the company promises to buy five additional garbage trucks for the Evansdale run so that its service to the other two towns is not affected.
          Calculate the new apportionment.

                What is your new Standard Divisor?
                It will probably change because you have changed both your total population and the number of seats.

      \HOMEWORK The following problems are based on the following story: Your professor found a stash of fun,
      math toys in her office.
      She decides to apportion the toys among her three first-year advisees according to the number of minutes each student spent doing homework during the week.

              Suppose that there were 11 toys in the office.
              Given that Ben did homework for a total of 54 minutes, Paul did homework for a total of 243 minutes and Ryan did homework for a total of 703 minutes,
              apportion the 11 toys among the students using Hamilton's method.

                    Consider closely who will have the largest fractional part.\ifgradersolns Because Kathryn's fractional part is .53,
                    and all the standard quotas must sum to exactly 15,
                    the other fractional parts must sum to .47.
                    Therefore, if there are any extra toys, Kathryn will get at least her upper quota because she has the largest fractional part \fi

              The Modified Divisor is, for Jefferson's Method,
              a divisor slightly smaller than the Standard Divisor.

              The Modified Lower Quota is where the population is divided by the Modified Divisor and then rounded down.
              The hope is that you will get exactly the correct apportionment at this point.\else

          According to the Bananarama constitution,
          the seats in the legislature are apportioned to the states according to their populations.

            Guess a new, Modified Divisor which is less than,
            but close to, your Standard Divisor.
            Use that to calculate new Modified Lower Quotas.
            If the total of your MLQ is the same as the number of seats,
            you are finished.
            Otherwise, you need to repeat this process until you find a MD that gives you the correct number of seats.

          Waterloo General Hospital has a nursing staff of 175 nurses working in four shifts:
          <m>A</m> (7:00 AM to 1:00 PM), <m>B</m> (1:00 PM to 7:00 PM), <m>C</m> (7:00 PM to 1:00 AM), <m>D</m> (1:00 AM to 7:00 AM).
          The number of nurses apportioned to each shift is based on the average number of patients treated in that shift,

          <em>Modified Upper Quota:</em>
          <answer>
            <p>
              Because we will have too many seats apportioned with Adam's Method,
              you need to choose a Modified Upper Quota that is a bit LARGER than the Standard Quota.\else

          Waterloo General Hospital has a nursing staff of 175 nurses working in four shifts:
          <m>A</m> (7:00 AM to 1:00 PM), <m>B</m> (1:00 PM to 7:00 PM), <m>C</m> (7:00 PM to 1:00 AM), <m>D</m> (1:00 AM to 7:00 AM).
          The number of nurses apportioned to each shift is based on the average number of patients treated in that shift,
          given in the following table:

                    Regular rounding gives one too few seats,
                    so the MD must be just a bit smaller.
