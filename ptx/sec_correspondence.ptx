  <title>What does
  <q>2</q>
  mean?</title>
  <p>
    Our journey to infinity begins with 2.
    We are all familiar with 2, and we will use that intuitive intimacy to develop a concept of size that will take us well beyond what we know.
  </p>

    If we have two apples and two hands,
    we could put one apple in each hand,
    and no hand would be un-appled, or any apple un-handed.
    If we have two socks and we put one sock on each hand,
    then our socks and our hands correspond exactly.
    This observation also implies that we can put one apple in each sock and demonstrate that the socks and apples also correspond;
    however, we do not recommend this last experiment unless the socks are clean.

    <em>One-to-one Correspondence:</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Grappling with infinity requires us to imagine physical scenarios that are not quite possible but can be clearly conceived in the mind.
    Suppose we have a huge barrel full of Volvos and a barrel full of soccer balls,
    and we want to know if there are more Volvos than soccer balls,
    more soccer balls than Volvos,
    or the same number of each.
    How would we decide?
  </p>
  <p>
    We could take one Volvo from the first barrel and one soccer ball from the second,
    pair them up and put them aside
    (probably putting the ball in the car's trunk).
    Then we could pair up another Volvo from the first barrel with another soccer ball from the second.
    If we continue pairing in this way and every car has a ball and every ball has a car,
    we know there are the same number of each.
  </p>
  <p>
    This simple idea is important.
    We have just described a method for determining when two collections have the same number of objects in them without actually naming that number.
    Two collections whose objects can be paired together evenly-one from one collection with one from the other collection-are said to have a
    <em>one-to-one correspondence</em>.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>The same, but unsure how much</em>.
          We have used a method of checking whether two sets of objects have the same number of things by pairing up and removing one object from each set until we run out.
          If we run out of objects from both sets at the same time,
          then we know that the sets contain the same number of things.
          Otherwise, we know that one set is larger than the other.
          Describe several events whereby we are able to compare the size of two collections without computing the individual sizes-for example,
          people filling all seats in an auditorium.

          Is there a one-to-one correspondence between allowable social security numbers and U.S. residents?
